Just documenting my journey into hooks, slowly wading through the amazing blog post by Mr Dan, <span style="color:blue">[Amazing blog post on Hooks](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) 
</span><br>

Interesting things I've learnt 

useEffect happenings are contained inside each hook

Whenever the useEffect is invoked, it will take the current state and the props when it is rendered

Code snippet from the blog post

```js
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {    
	setTimeout(() => {      
		console.log(`You clicked ${count} times`);    
		}, 3000);  });
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

The console log will output 3 seconds whenever setCount is called, using the count value from whence it is invoked. 

"You should think of effects in a similar way. useEffect lets you synchronize things outside of the React tree according to our props and state."

This is different from componentDidUpdate that was used previously, where this.state takes the value of the current state


```js
componentDidUpdate() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`You clicked ${this.state.count} times`);
    }, 3000);
  }

```
