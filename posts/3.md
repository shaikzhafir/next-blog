# A list of stuff i wished i knew before wasting hours trying to deploy 

### Heroku backend setup
1) Don't forget to replicate .env files in heroku/vercel config secret keys
2) Set the app to listen to process.env.PORT || your localhost setup
3) Allow CORS (haha heard this is bad but security is for future considerations)


### Vercel frontend setup
1) Proxy using package.json did not work out, had to write a helper function to append the backend APU URL to all the fetch requests 
2) Had to configure vercel.json to allow rewrites to the current url, website was returning 404 errors when the Link class wasnt used 

``` json 
{
    // vercel.json config file
    "public": false,
    "builds": [
      { "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }
    ],
    "rewrites":  [
      {"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/"}
    ]
   
  }
```


#### Then again, pain is the best teacher. Happy that I wasted hours trying to deploy.
