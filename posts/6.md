#Diving into Go 

Some interesting topics that I always think about will be detailed here. 

## WIP 
 

### 1) Pointers*&*&

Yes the last time I touched pointers was in year 1 in university. I had to revisit it. I think it will take a while for me to appreciate it.
Referred heavily to this explanation 
https://dave.cheney.net/2017/04/26/understand-go-pointers-in-less-than-800-words-or-your-money-back

The mantra being 
#### "A pointer is a value that points to the memory address of another variable"
\* and & can be confusing
\* can refer to two things 
1) declaring a pointer to a type  (OR declaring a value that points to the memory address of a type) 
```go
var lala int = 3
var poop *int = &lala

```
2) dereferencing an address 
```go
fmt.Println(poop) //will output some address
fmt.Println(*poop) //will output 3
```
& refers to the address of a variable!



### 1) Pass by copy vs pass by reference in Go

Was confused with a notion of this and had to consult the internet big brainers and found this article that was continuously referenced, https://dave.cheney.net/2017/04/29/there-is-no-pass-by-reference-in-go


Generally it seems that when primitives (arrays, structs) are reassigned, a copy will be created.
This will generally make you think, pass by copy 

For example, below shows it happening by reassigning an array

```go
a := [3]int{3,4,5}
b := a //makes a copy of a
b[1] = 9 
fmt.Println(b) // will print out [3,9,5]
fmt.Println(a) // unchanged , [3,4,5]
```

For non primitives, (slices and maps), it will be pass by reference 

Example below shows reassiging a slice

```go
a := []int{3,4,5,6} //a slice
b := a 
b[1] = 9 
fmt.Println(b) // will print out [3,9,5]
fmt.Println(a) // changed as well , [3,9,5]

```

Why does this happen? The way I see it, the non primitives are in a way, not pointing at the actual data structure in itself; i.e they are pointing to a projection of that something.
