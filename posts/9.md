## Definition of a pointer

**A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.**

## Definitions of \* and &

### 1. & ( Address )

\* you can copy paste the code below and run in [go playground](https://go.dev/play/)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    str := `this is a string`
    test := &str
    fmt.Println(test)
    //output will be someth like 0xc000010230, which is a memory address
}

```

So instead of that variable you will get some address that can be resolved by \***\*_drumrolls_\*\***

### 2. \* ( Address dereferencer )

just replace the code in main() if you are following along in go playground

```go

str := `this is a string`
memoryAddress := &str
fmt.Println(memoryAddress)  //outputs some memory address
fmt.Println(*memoryAddress) //outputs the string!

//its basically putting a * infront of a &, as shown here
fmt.Println(*&str) //outputs the string!

```

**_\* is used infront of a variable that stores memory address of another variable_**

Usually some variables can take up too much memory space when theyre being passed around as variables. Passing by pointers makes it less intensive as youre only passing around a memory address variable

Only when you need to use it, you can use \* to dereference it.

### BUT WAIT A MINUTE THERES ANOTHER MEANING FOR \*

### 2.5 \* is used to initialise a pointer type

```go

str := `another string`
var stringPointer *string = &str

fmt.Println(str) //output a string
fmt.Println(*stringPointer) //output a dereferenced pointer, which is a string

fmt.Println(&str) //output address
fmt.Println(stringPointer) //output a pointer to a string type address, which was assigned to &str

```
