# Golang for the JS dev

Here to make the transition easier for myself.

This is more of a beginner level article and will be focusing on

1. Initialising an array
2. Modifying an array
3. Looping through an array

## Arrays

### In JS

In JS declaring arrays are just very simple

```js
let arr = [];
```

Need to push into the array?

```js
arr.push("test"); // output is ["test"]
```

Need to loop through? You can use the typical for loop but let's just go with foreach

```js
arr.forEach((ele) => console.log(ele));
//will output "test"
```

### In Go

First things first, there are (kind of) two different kinds of arrays you can work with

Arrays and Slices.

Arrays are built with a fixed size, whereas you can take slices to be a projection of an array that can be changed

```go
var []string 

```
