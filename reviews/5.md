# Summary
Divorced by his wife, painter lives in a famous painter's house, seeks to rediscover his "style" of painting.

Finds a painting titled killing commendatore, draws parallels to his style? Possibly. Commissioned by a enigmatic neighbour Menshiki to draw his portrait, finds that he is able to reproduce a person's likeness, like in a 4th dimension sorta way. Very cool

# Cool concepts 
Pour enough soul into a work to make it have a soul of it's own. Able to exert a tangible force onto the world through the result of his painting.
Coincidences , parallels drawn across different characters,
1.Age of sister and mariye
2.Relationship with author and wife, Menshiki and lover
3.Uncertainty of child parentage for main and menshiki

Overall the concepts of ideas and metaphors seemed rather whimsical? Too abstract? Maybe lost in translation. But kinda understand what it was trying to portray how elements in a painting can be reproduced in the real world.

Would give it a solid 8/10 , bumped from a 7 cos the story actually has a satisfying end for a murakami book haha. A classic Murakami book.
