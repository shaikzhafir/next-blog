# Summary

William Stoner is born at the end of the nineteenth century into a dirt-poor Missouri farming family. Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.

# Thoughts

Phew, first relatively "literature-esque" book i had the pleasure of reading in a looong time. Took over a month to finish reading this, mainly because of the constant pitying I felt for the main character. (Cmon man can this guy get a break, having some "A little life" flashbacks over here)

# Breakdown of key moments in Stoner's life

## Farm life

Not much can be said here, (tbh cant recall much) other than his hunger for knowledge. Initially finding it difficult to understand and grasp his intro to literature (i think), he spent much time seeking the beauty behind it, his extreme interest in English Literature causing him to forsake and abandon his parents in his selfish pursuit at the University. Wonder if asian parenting led to me being uncomfortable about this part of the story. 
Perhaps in other regions where filial piety isn't practiced as much, this path is more accepted

## Marriage  

Enamored with Edith after seeing her once at a post party, our boy Stoner went all out to get our fair skinned thin lady. Felt like the attraction was mainly because of her being "high class", with Edith being more of an ornament to have, owing to Stoner's humble family background.

Man oh man did Edith prove to be a handful (taking advantage of Stoner's stoic approach, Edith did some horrid things such as alienating Stoner from his daughter and limiting his study area (pushing him over to the basement or some shit) are just some of the horrid things she has done). 

This I believe primarily due to the life with Stoner not giving her the satisfaction that she desired. During Stoner's final moments, he did ruminate, in a rather painful realization, 

"If I had been stronger, he thought. If I had known more; if I could have understood. And finally, mercilessly, he thought: if I had loved her more". 

Man that hit like a truck..  

From his perspective though, he did live according to his morals/takes on life to the best of his abilities, with the circumstances just being unkind to him. Particularly enjoyed his "war" with Lommax, with Lommax's favourite student as a proxy for it. Lommax, what a prick. 

# Verdict

Might improve on this piece as I reread some parts? I did enjoy this novel as it painted the life of a perfectly ordinary person with humble beginnings, and a sad, quiet end. 

A reviewer called it anti-Gatsby, and I couldn't agree more with that description. Read this if you want to try something different (or if you have some severe case of schadenfreude and want to derive pleasure from the pain of Stoner)
