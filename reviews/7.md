# Summary  

Continuation from a wild sheep chase by murakami, a man finds himself compelled to return to the mysterious dolphin hotel (someth abt someone he knew from before crying) and he spirals down into a wack journey, a usual feature of murakami stories. tormentors.

# Review 

Trying to uncover who killed Mei felt like a homage to Raymond Chandler's detective novels, albeit with tinged with some supernatural elements. It honestly felt super draggy especially the early to mid section of the book, him being attracted to glasses girl and simultaneously trying to uncover what is drawing him back to the dolphin hotel. 

However, the story really picks up and became interesting after **something** happened to Mei the sensual snow shoveller (love this term), and the whole two cops interrogating our main char felt straight outta a Raymond Chandler novel.

The Ame family was very entertaining to learn about as well, from the insanely banal father, the extremely talented but socially unaware mother, it was intriguing to witness our main character bungle through as his life gets intertwined with the mess that is their family life.
