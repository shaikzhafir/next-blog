Oh man overdue review on this, let's see if i can cook something up.



Really really enjoyed the generational tale with the unique characters showcasing their motivations and the circumstances that shape their decisions, and for some, their demise.



Felt really sad for Noa as a whole, torn between knowing that he was fathered by what he feels is whatever he stands against, even led to him abandoning everything in his life. This sacrifice was worth the pain/shame? he feels from having known the relation he has to koh hansu. Eventually even led to the ultimate sacrifice of his own life when his mother came to visit him and further escape was not worth it.Â 



Mozasu and his son's story didnt feel that great to me, neither did his policeman gay friend lmao but hey more representation, always for that.



Would draw comparisons to 100 years of solitude but personally feel that its lacking. Probably in its symbolism and just beauty in writing. Highly enjoyable nontheless.
