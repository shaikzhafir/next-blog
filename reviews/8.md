# Summary  

The Hound of the Baskervilles is the third of the four crime novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

Story starts off strong with a client requesting for help with a mysterious case with supernatural leanings that immediately piques the interest of our boy Sherlock.
This time however he leaves Watson to deal with it alone, as he settles some other pressing matters. The story then follows Watson's accounts as he bumbles through 
the case coming no closer to concluding it

# Review 

First Sherlock story in a looong while, had fond memories reading some of the stories, can't really remember much of the previous works.

Felt that the Watson-only parts of the novel to be a refreshing take, as he laid down the facts as he sees it and tries his best to solve the case
and keeping the client safe, without the help of Sherlock. Protect Watson at all costs.

When Sherlock returns however is when the story picks up really fast with rather shocking revelations that really made me laugh out loud, in a good way. 


#### Verdict

A solid detective novel, with a satisfying end. There's a reason why Sherlock Holmes still stands the test of time, with our endearing duo and the 
intricate plots and interesting characters. Highly recommend.
