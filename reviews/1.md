# Summary  
Ultra violent 15 year old teen acts on his own impulses and gratification at the expense of others (Not sure if the lack of applying the golden rule aspect mattered at all in the eyes of the author? It was clearly omitted in the eyes of our Honourable Narrator, even at the end of the redemptive chapter)

Gets caught after accidentally murdering an old woman with a phallic statue ( ha )

Jailed and then underwent the ludovico treatment to induce an strong aversion against violence and inhibit Alex against committing such acts. 

Aftermath being he feels really sorry for himself and proceeds to jump off a building when listening to beethoven leads him to feel extreme pain.

After hypnopaedic treatment he is back to his original self and feels happy again, rude to his parents etc etc. Shortly after becomes disillusioned with his earlier impulses at the start of the book, meets his droog who is fairly set in life , wants to be like him

Author seems to say that let teens be teens, is free will at the expense of extreme violence worth having it? 

Or controlled thought and forcing good upon people at the expense of choice the alternative? One can say it will lead to a totaliarian state, restricting people from actually living. But man. If it works, it works is the mantra.

Just have to know the trade off I guess. 

Urgh what a horrid book though. Not enjoyable.
