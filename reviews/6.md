# Summary  

A bold foray into new literary territory, Kawakamiâ€™s novel is told in the voice of a 14-year-old student subjected to relentless torment for having a lazy eye. Instead of resisting, the boy chooses to suffer in complete resignation. The only person who understands what he is going through is a female classmate who suffers similar treatment at the hands of her tormentors.

# Review 

Yo love the romance in the first few parts. Just two people vibing and being on the same wavelength, just makes me smile all the time

Ultimately confused by the blatant bullying and unrepentant attitudes by the bullies (as intended by the author). Weird how this seems to keep happening in Japan? Feels like teachers tend to be so unassertive its stressful.

### Monologue by Momose
#### His view 

It can be condensed to "fuck the golden rule". No one owes another a good experience to each other. Nothing matters in this world. All the teachings about being nice from religions and cultures are just a way for the weak to cope with the nature of the dog eat dog world. "People do what they can get away with"

#### My thoughts

The only reason for the golden rule is for weak people to thrive? Feels like something people in privileged positions can blurt out easily as they have never been in a compromised state? He perceives the world as black and white; the ones who assert themselves and the ones who are dominated. Flawed thinking ? Probably. Will he ever get punished for it from his position? Probably not. Does it matter? Probably not as well.

### Monologue by Kogami

#### Her view 

Stand by what makes you weak ; Weakness in itself is strength. 

#### My thoughts 

I can't help but view it as a coping mechanism by Kogami to patch up her less than stellar upbringing. She's just trying to make a sense of the world she's in, using a framework to stand by and comprehend situations and emerging stronger for it.

How else can you cope with such meaningless bullying?

Another view will be, she doesn't even care about any of the shit at school, just really wants to have something strong to identify her dad by. Really admirable yet poignant mindset.

Overall a really solid book with very interesting characters and a nuanced view on adolescence, no regrets purchasing it on Kindle.

#### Verdict

Hahhh. Heaven ? Or hell? Hell, it's heaven.
