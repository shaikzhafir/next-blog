Plot:

Story is narrated first hand from Keiko, (a mildly autistic person?) who finds solace in working as a convenience store worker throughout most of her adult life. 


Thoughts:

Fuck the shirablabla guy, just a useless person who could never come to terms with reality as it is and instead continue living as a burden on others while clinging on to his warped sense of morality or how things should be, expecting reality to revolve and accede to his demands and unfairly takes advantage of Keiko  


Phrase:

Phrase that I vibed with, "normality -however messy- is far more comprehensible"


Verdict:

A really short and enjoyable novel throughout, as readers get to experience life from Keiko's perspective and her view of society and the clownery that everyone seems to partake in. Really loved the ending as she embraces her identity at the end.
