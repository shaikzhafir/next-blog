To send a message of "Greetings" 

Love how the overarching theme of the book is repeated again and again in the various chapters 

# Summary

Started with Constant and his frivolous life as a super lucky guy, 

gets sent to Mars as a ploy by Rumfood to amass together an army to invade Earth and has everything removed from his memory. Starts a new life as as soldier but keeps remembering his past ( as a result of him being very lucky?), and kept having his memory wiped. 

Eventually the army embarked to Earth and it was annihilated (mostly by thermonuclear missiles) 


Reason behind the meaningless(as it seemed) deaths was to enforce a new religion (the Church of the indifferent god lmao) that taught some wacky form of equality based in handicaps for people (perfect eyesight man wearing his wife's glasses), rejecting luck which was a cornerstone for our friend Constant, who becomes a martyr for the cause of this new religion and thus exiled to Titan. 


It is worth reading simply for the ending. What a book. Nothing matters and it is OK !
