# Summary 

Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.

Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again.


# Prior Thoughts
My second Agatha Christie novel, this one seemed relatively short, finished reading it in less half a day. "And then there was none" blew my mind when I read it in lower sec school (a dead person committing the crime...). 

Always assumed Poirot was a middle aged french woman before reading this book. I couldn't be further from the truth.

# Reading Thoughts

Alot of french phrases littered throughout, didn't really bother translating on my kindle.

#### Minor spoilers? Won't really say what happened but yeah be warned

Truly an interesting mystery, well premeditated crime. Loved it when the murderer placed the kimono in Poirot's suitcase. ("The game is afoot!" vibes). Quite interesting to see how seemingly unrelated cabin mates be actually very much related. Liked Poirot's observation on how unusually packed the train is with a diverse cast when its usually empty at this time of year. (There can be no such coincidences). As usual, in hindsight things always made sense. Poirot is da man who saw it before the hindsighters, way to go.

Loved the part where everyone sat and started thinking, Bouc and Constantine just having the most random,unrelated and inane thoughts while Poirot was solving the case was a nice funny moment.

The collaborative stabbing reminded me somewhat of Caesars death, wonder if that's an inspiration


# Verdict 

Truly a worthwhile whodunnit murder mystery, if you have a few hours to spare and enjoy a good mystery novel, give it a read! 

12/12 (if you know you know)
